# <Horiseon Accessibility - Module 1 Challenge>

## A marketing agency required a refactor of an existing site to make it more accessible.

- The motivation for this project was to redesign a webpage that would be inclusive of visually impaired users.
- This project was built so that visually impaired user can easily navigate the websits.
- Some users may use a screen reader to navigate websites therefore the HTML must be descriptive and semantic.
- I have learnt how to correct the CSS code in order to retain the original look of the website when changing HTML to semantic HTML and how to include alt descriptions for images.
